This repository demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to asynchronous data access.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, attempting to access data before it's fully loaded from Firestore. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes promises or async/await to ensure the data is available before accessing it.  This is a critical issue because prematurely accessing data results in undefined behavior and potentially crashes. Understanding asynchronous operations in Firebase is vital for robust app development.
